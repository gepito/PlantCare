# Process Oxirat 

## Ration oxigen by solenoide valve to most effective consumption

Oxigen flows in short pulses tuned to brething frequency to be consumed as effectively as possible.

The project is using the same hardware as PlantCare, solenoid valve in place of pump.

Periode/duty: 5/0.2 s as initial guess

DO NOT FORGET TO ADD FLYBACK DIODE!

# Measurement conditions:

p(prim) = 180 atm
p(sec) = 1 atm
t(on) = 10 ms
bottle | reducer | 3 m blue tube | solenoide | 0.2 m pneu tube | diffusor

D = 140 mm, h = 3 (30/10) mm
V = 44 cm^3 = 0.44 l


## vital capacity:

casual outbreath

D = 140 mm, h = 160 mm
V = 2300 cm^3

44 cm^3 O2 : ~ 20 -> 22% 

## working time:

2 m^3 @ 44 cm^3 / 5s rate -> 0,2e6 s -> __60 days__
