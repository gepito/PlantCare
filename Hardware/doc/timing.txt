- every minute: 
	measure temperature, moisture, 
	check water level
	calculate if water needed
	log results

- measurement:
	moisture 3 * 100 ms conditioning, measure 8* (?)
	pump current
	if ((pump current) and (no pump activation)) set failure
	
- ping watchdog 
	if (not failure) in every 20 ms

- water dispenser: 
	if ((water needed) and (water level OK)) for the time volume / flow

- algorythm
	if (dry time > dry periode) water needed
