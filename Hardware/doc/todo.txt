
- create system design with 
	multiple (sensor, pump) channels (?)
	watchdog
	emergency shutdown
- install level sensor
- study power supply alternatives, accumulator charging
- connect pump, calibrate pump activation periode
- complete logging with temperature, conductivity, pump activation, date, time, power on
- define irrigation parameters (max conductivity, dry periode, 
v- connect SDA, SCL to JP1/9, 10 @ Arduino Leonardo, cut SDA, SCL from A0, A1 of Leonardo @ proto logger shield
v- r5 wrong position - pull up 1w line @ proto shield
v- fix D7-D9 of Leonardo @ proto shield
v- fix A0-A3 of Leonardo @ proto shield



v- mount DS1820
- design & care PCB: add FLASH/EEPROM, RTC, temperature sensor, switch, failsafe
	shield format(?), 1-(4?) channels design
	atMega/ESP12 controller with WIFI, web server, alert (?)
v- is there CR 1220 batt. in stock?

v- check supply output voltage
v- check if dacq board gnd is connected
v- reposition sensor and FET driver ports (D2, D3 are used for I2C as well)
v- mount 6 pol header for SPI lines,
v- cut SDA, SCL from A4, A5 @ dacq board
v- mount level switch connector @  care PCB A5


Schematic:
v- level sensor to A5 allowing multi level switches at one wire
