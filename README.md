# PlantCare

## Hardware and software to implement life sustaining environment for plants

The aim of this project is to be system oriented. Dealing with sensors, actuators, control and providing failsafe concept.

The principles of workflow are

- use comercially available components wherever possible for cost effective implementation
- provide effective means of monitoring the hardware-software-plant ecosystem
- improve the the components limiting the quality of the system - well, we may actually improve hardware and software only :)
